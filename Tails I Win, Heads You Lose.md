# Tails I Win, Heads You Lose.
*A scenario for Star Wars D6 where players learn the meaning of the term ‚Äúgilded cage‚Äù, and where the gamemaster strives to illustrate the different forms of character paranoia.*

**Translator random notes:**  I've used footnotes to mark things where appropriate. The terms ‚ÄúLas Vegas‚Äù, ‚Äúsunglasses‚Äù have been replaced with a more descriptive explanation. I added heavy blaster pistols to the goons since they had no weapons. I changed ‚ÄúBob Macpherson‚Äù to ‚ÄúRoba Spierre‚Äù, because that‚Äôs totally a boring Earth name and not a Star Wars one. Aaron Prast is supposed to have an actual coin from Mexico on Earth ‚Äì I left that out and just called it a piece of gold.

## The Missing Link
The Rebellion has entrusted the characters with an important mission. In less than 72 hours, a rebel fleet will pass through the local sector, and will need to make a stopover at the **Itkal Rebel base** and the base's facilities must be ready in time.

To do this, the characters must take this message to a contact who will pass it on to another contact, and so on until the Itkal officials have been notified. This procedure is commonly used by the Rebel Intelligence Services, when comms channels might be compromised or monitored by the Empire.

The characters must meet their contact on **Lax III**, an important astroport[^2] in the system; their contact‚Äôs name is a man called **Vaklav Herss**. Herss will leave immediately after the message is delivered to meet another messenger in a place known only to him and will continue the message hand-off. The journey to Lax III poses no problem, and the characters can use their own transport methods or even commercial shipping to reach the destination. 

[^2]: A French starport is called an astroport and it sounds way cooler than the English version.

Once on Lax III, they are to rendezvous with Herss in the central terminal of the astroport. When the appointed time arrives, (1500 local time), the messenger arrives. Vaklav is a tall, bony, even emaciated man, dressed like a commercial traveler and obviously without much research. Ten meters away from the player characters he will throw them a look like a hunted beast and start running in the opposite direction.

Immediately, three figures in dark suits and eyewear will chase him.

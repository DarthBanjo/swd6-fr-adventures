# Tails I Win, Heads You Lose.
*A scenario for Star Wars D6 where players learn the meaning of the term “gilded cage”, and where the gamemaster strives to illustrate the different forms of character paranoia.*

**Translator random notes:** A French starport is called an astroport and it sounds way cooler than the english version. The terms “Las Vegas”, “sunglasses” have been replaced with a more descriptive explanation. I added heavy blaster pistols to the goons since they had no weapons. I changed “Bob Macpherson” to “Roba Spierre”, because that’s totally a boring Earth name and not a Star Wars one. Aaron Prast is supposed to have an actual coin from Mexico on Earth – I left that out and just called it a piece of gold.

*Translator random notes: I've used footnotes to mark things where appropriate.* 

[^1]: I came up with the scenario blurb above to match the first translated scenario, ‚ÄúTails I Win, Heads You Lose.‚Äù
[^2]: I also changed Paloma City to be located in a hilly jungle region ‚Äì Star Wars doesn‚Äôt need another desert planet.
[^3]: In the French version, Locos has a Blaster Pistol (4D), a comlink, and 100 credits. However, to support his "living on the street", I removed all belongings so he couldn't just use the credits or comlink to call the Empire for rescue.
[^4]: I made the typical pirate one pip better in all stats in order to save on several lines of skills which were all at 2D+1. 
[^5]: There are no stats provided for the  ‚Äúextremely powerful combat droids‚Äù mentioned in Act 7, but I‚Äôm sure a crafty gamemaster can come up with something if needed.

**This scenario can be played at any point in the Star Wars timeline. The player characters can act on behalf of the New Republic, the Alliance, or they could also be tramp freighter pilots who arrive here out of dumb luck.**

## Act 1: Arrival
The Player Characters arrive on Paloma one fine morning. Paloma city is quite visually similar to Mos Eisley. Barely will they have disembarked when two local enforcement droids, known as Procurators, will come to meet them. 

They‚Äôre accompanied by a third droid, an observer unit who will introduce themselves as **Scylla**. 

Observer droids are responsible for accompanying offworlders throughout their stay, informing them about the planet's laws, and keeping track of the total amount of their fines. They will have to pay these before leaving the planet.

As soon as the introductions are made, the two Procurators will move away, and Scylla will be able to explain the penal code to them, which is completely incomprehensible. The heroes will have to try to limit the damage by committing as few offenses as possible. Small firearms are allowed in the city, but their use is prohibited. The droids love to test people!

After their arrival, it is advisable for the gamemaster to let the adventurers wander around to discover the city. They will notice that there are few security droids in the streets. People are relaxed and smiling. They are particularly welcoming to strangers. In fact, they greatly appreciate visitors since, thanks to the fines that they pay, the inhabitants of the city are not taxed at all.

### Paloma Planetary Bio
*Paloma is a small planet located on the edge of known space, near the Kathol sector. It has no apparent strategic importance and possesses no valuable resources. The only major city on Paloma is called Paloma City, and 75% of the population is human while the rest are made up of various alien species. Approximately half of the people who come to Paloma are native to the planet, while others were forced to relocate there after losing everything due to the planet's laws. The area around the capitol is an hilly jungle region[^2] inhabited by dangerous creatures that prowl the region.*

*The planet is terrestrial and has a hot temperature. Its day lasts 22 standard hours, and its year is 359 local days. The planet is home to various intelligent races, including humans. Paloma has a standard astroport, and its estimated population is 40,000 people. The planet's main function is commerce, and it is governed by a council. Its level of technology is space, and its main exports are components for droids while its main imports are high-tech goods.*

## Act 2: A Desperate Agent
When touring the town, the characters will eventually meet **Locos Mar**. He was an agent of the Imperial Security Bureau (ISB). Unfortunately for him, he has accumulated so much debt that the Procurators have confiscated all his belongings. For several years, he has been living in the city like a vagabond, trying to find a way to contact the Empire or convince someone to take him away from this crazy world.

**Note:** If the scenario is played after the fall of the Empire, Locos is not aware of the fall of the Empire, and will be very surprised to learn about it!

Locos is not a bad person, he is a basic agent with only one obsession: to return home. He will stick to the adventurers like a little dog and help them as best he can. But be careful, if betraying the PCs can allow him to leave the planet, he will not hesitate for a second. Moreover, if he can serve the Empire by arresting a band of rebels while being sure to be able to leave Paloma, he will do it.

**Quote:** *"They impounded my ship because I urinated on a wall. Pathetic. You won't find a cleaner place than that."*

## Act 3: Trouble Begins
After the adventurers have visited the city and made acquaintances with Locos and the Procurators, they will inevitably come back to the cantina. That's where things will get tougher.

Indeed, a group of passing pirates has just landed on Paloma. The ruffians have a hard time accepting the presence of their Observer droid that accompanies them everywhere. Once they arrive at the cantina, one of the pirates will start provoking customers (including the heroes).

The pirates‚Äô Observer Droid will signal several infractions to the pirates, and the thugs will lose patience and destroy the small droid. The pirates will then start a real brawl that will end with blaster shots. The pirates, when they see additional Procurator droids arrive, will try to flee to reach the hangar and their shuttle, shooting at everything that moves. 

There are fourteen  in the cantina. The clients will try above all to hide. Locos will try to help the player characters even if he's a very cowardly character. The cantina owner (**Zrothar**, a well-spoken Gammorrean) will also defend his establishment .



üî≥ **Typical Pirate**  
All stats 2D+1[^4], except: **Knowledge 1D+2**,  Blaster 3D+1, Dodge 3D+1, Brawling 2D+2, Gambling 3D. Blaster pistol (4D), comlink, and blast vest (+1D physical/+1 energy).

Once the battle in the cantina is over, whether the pirates managed to escape or not, the adventurers will be surprised to hear their Observer droid listing all the things they destroyed during the fight, and they will be fined heavily for using weapons in the city. The total amount of the fine is quite significant, and any negotiation with the droid is futile.

It is at this point that some pirates, who stayed aboard their ship in orbit, will organize a retaliatory raid against the city. Two Z-95 Headhunter fighters will strafe Paloma with ion cannon blasts. 

If the players somehow convince the Procurators to allow them to intervene, they might be able to use their ship to fight against the pirate vessels. One player will be required to stay on the planet as a safeguard. The players might reduce their fines by 20% if they do this, assuming no other damage is done to the city. If the player characters do not intervene, the pirates will make a few passes over the city before leaving.

### The Laws of Paloma
The governing body of the planet is composed of shareholders of the Fibra-Bot corporation, which produces components for droids. The government has long entrusted the responsibility of maintaining law to the Procurators, which is composed entirely of droids. The planet has built an extremely complex legal code that only the droids can fully understand.

The law applies more particularly to the offworlders passing through Paloma; the droids are much more lenient with the local inhabitants. 

Upon visiting, one will soon realize that any minor infraction, no matter how insignificant, can result in a significant penalty, and in cases where payment is not possible, may even require unpaid labor in the factory. It also often happens that the droids decide to confiscate an individual's ship who is unable to pay his fines. 

Paloma is therefore a calm city. Strangers are easily identifiable, whether because they are accompanied by an Observer droid, or they hang out in bars looking for a kind soul who will take them away from this planet, their belongings having been confiscated. A small consolation comes when Procurators have seized all the possessions of an individual or have sentenced him to work at the Fibra Bot factory ‚Äì they become local citizens and no longer are followed by an Observer droid.

Many have decided to leave the world after spending years trying to pay off their debts.

The gamemaster is encouraged to invent all the laws they can, especially if they are obscure and contradict each other. In any case, only the Procurators understand their logic. At the beginning of the adventure, the instructions for the laws are only sanctioned by fines; things will get worse later on.


![paloma]

### Paloma City
1. **Runways and Hangar Bays** - These are the locations where the players ship might land. There are also ten other locations around the city for starships to land. Each hangar is guarded by two Procurator droids. More droid guards can show up if things go wrong.
2. **Fibra-Bot Factory** - This is where most of the components for droids are made. The workers are mostly formerly offworlders who have accumulated debt and have been sentenced to work to pay it off. The factory is guarded by eight Procurators.
Droid Governor‚Äôs Office - It is from this building that the droid governor manages the Contractual Legal Force and the city. It is described in Act 6.
Cantina - This is the meeting place for all the inhabitants of the city and the largest cantina in Paloma. Droids rarely set foot there. The owner, Zrothar, is a slightly more intelligent Gamorrean who fled his fellow beings to avoid being despised and ridiculed by them. He hates droids but enjoys life on the planet. The heroes can count on his help when things get rough.
Sle‚Äôs Hotel - The Fungus is a small hotel completely run by a woman named Sle. She is a particularly sly merchant who will use any tricks to extract a few extra credits from the players.
Ban‚Äôs Hardware - This hardware store is run by Ban Loso, a fifty-year-old human who knows the city like the back of his hand. He can get almost any merchandise, but for weapons, he can only obtain blaster gas, melee weapons, and blaster pistols. He keeps some grenades, protective vests, and four thermal detonators in stock. If the players can convince him, he can provide them with this equipment when things go wrong.
Mechanic‚Äôs shop - Val Kimlrest is a brilliant mechanic and droid specialist who is constantly protected by a Procurator. However, he is a prisoner of this planet. Indeed, the droids refuse to let him leave because he is the only one who can repair the machines that break down. He can be very useful to the heroes at the end of this adventure, to repair the Governor. The droids are desperately looking for qualified individuals in machine repair. If a player shows particular talent in this area, there is a good chance that they will be noticed by the Procurators‚Ä¶
Impound Lot - Vol Green is a 98-year-old man who was born on this world and knows it particularly well. He is not very sociable and finds it deplorable that it is the droids who police the planet. He constantly criticizes their actions and calls them all kinds of names. The players can find Vol in prison, and Vol can give them the location of the Impound lot, where all confiscated ships and equipment are stored.
Speeder Rental - You can find almost any type of speeder in this hangar, and you can rent or buy them.
The Elders - This group of six old men wander around the city and love to make fun of newcomers. They laugh in advance at what will happen to them. They are fervent defenders of the droid law and even when things turn bad, they will find any pretext to justify their actions. They will not hesitate to denounce people unnecessarily. You can find them absolutely anywhere, sitting on a bench and making fun of everyone who passes by.
The Prisons - (See Act 6)


**Gamemaster Note:** The deduction of the characters, although logical, is incorrect. The Imperial counterintelligence operatives have set up a diabolical strategy to get a hold of the data carried by the couriers. The ticket on Vaklav is part of a plan by agents of the Empire to lure the characters to the station, and have them meet with agents of the Empire who will pretend to be the couriers of the Rebellion. It‚Äôs worth the risk, recent Rebellion couriers have been using mimetic drugs to make them highly immune to Imperial interrogation truth serums and torture. 

Pegasus XIII is a closed system where agents of the Empire can keep an eye on all aboard. If the information about the rebel fleet, the Lion system, or Itkal base (even just Itkal)  is spoken aboard the station, the Empire will know about it. This last bit of information is to be carefully managed by the gamemaster. If the information leaks, the Empire will know and the players and Rebellion will have to deal with all the consequences that entails.

A particularly clever character might legitimately wonder how the Empire's agents got the information. The confrontation in the cargo area seems to have been attempting to delay but not capture the players, let alone eliminate them. And with their disappearing at the end of the fight, is unlike the Empire‚Äôs methods. 

This thought should only be formed by a character with extensive experience in secret confrontations with the Empire or counterintelligence. It‚Äôs an accurate thought but cannot easily be confirmed. The imperial agents had to delay the players enough in order so that a subordinate could get a ticket to Pegasus XIII, and slip it onto the person of Vaklav. 

This clever deduction can be confirmed by the time of the withdrawal of the ticket (a few minutes before the exchange of fire in the cargo area). A moderate or difficult perception roll would indicate the time indicated on the ticket is three minutes after their rendezvous with Vaklav. Were the players on time? That might tip them off.

The ticket mystery will stop here: it was taken from a ticket machine and it is therefore useless to look for a hostess so that she can describe its buyer. It‚Äôs possible that the players have mistaken the time as the hour is enough incorrectly printed on it. Maybe the droid is incorrectly calibrated (this would not be the first time). It is the gamemaster‚Äôs job in this situation to give hints yet cause doubt. Why did their contact get a ticket to Pegasus XIII while he was pursued by the agents of the Empire?

Another asset to inquisitive characters: the agents of the Empire do not know Vaklav's identity. This is one reason the ticket is an open ticket, without a name and if the characters take time to search the corpse, they will not find any forms of identification. As a result of this discovery, any messenger they meet will inevitably have to know the name of Vaklav as they knew him. It is this discovery that might save the lives of the characters. As they take a cargo ship to Pegasus XIII, the characters may find that they are being followed, or at least accompanied. Or it could be completely normal, Lax III being one of the usual access ports to the orbiting station.

## Talking to an Agent of the Empire

If a player talks, voluntarily or not, out loud or over comms about the information the group is supposed to courier, an agent of the Empire will immediately intervene to get rid of the characters without further delay. A squad of Stormtroopers will attack the players before the Empire attacks the Rebel base at Itkal. This could make for some interesting consequences to work out in future game sessions!

### Roba Spierre
Roba[^4] approaches the characters as soon as they arrive on Pegasus XIII and immediately claims to be the rebels' agent. Characters, unless surprised or careless, should not fall into the trap because of a very simple clue: no one should have known they were going to Pegasus XIII and the Rebel agent awaited another contact. How would he know them?

[^4]: Originally named Bob Macpherson, I changed Roba's name to be more Star Wars-y and less of a boring Earth name.

Roba is in too much of a rush to close the deal. He acted out of order, which will cost him his life: his superiors decide to eliminate him so as not to risk confirming the doubts of the characters. Roba therefore disappears within an hour of his contact with the characters, who are left to draw their own conclusions. This much is known: someone knows their identity Pegasus XIII and was waiting for them, which is not reassuring.

**Capsule:** Of all the characters the players interact with, Roba Spierre is the only true agent of the Empire. He‚Äôs a good trooper but a poor spy. He will attempt to trap the players as soon as they arrive at Pegasus station, presenting himself as the next courier in the chain. Gamemasters are encouraged to channel their inner Bruce Willis in his voice, expressions, and characteristics. Roba has high ambitions, and is aware that success here would send his career on a high orbit trajectory. He is very pushy, punctuating his sentences with phrases like ‚ÄúYou see?‚Äù He should be a good distraction but should not be too difficult to overcome.

### Lily Langtree
Lily is a Pegasus XIII entertainer and hostess. With striking red hair, emerald eyes, and a sharp intelligence to match, she‚Äôs unfortunately an agent of the Empire. She advances her pawns with a lot of subtlety and only when winning is a sure bet that she will begin to show her cards. Only after the players show their trust will she let it be known that she may well be the agent the characters are looking for. Lily is the second attempt by Empire agents to get the courier information, but this time the trap is much more subtle.

![Lily]

If the characters mention Roba, the agent encountered during their arrival, Lily will feign fear and confess to the characters that he is an agent of the Empire who has been pursuing her for months (which does not explain why Roba knows the identity of the characters, but that's another story).

The characters can fall into the trap, especially since Lily's charms are strong and a person sensitive to this kind of arguments can lose their way. If they dig deeply they will uncover that Lily has arrived on Pegasus XIII at the same time as them and that, like them, she comes from Lax III. Of course, it could be a coincidence. If players ask Lily to explain herself, she will indicate that she took the post on Pegasus XIII 48 hours ago and before she was working at another leisure base, in the system of Leo. The characters can have doubts and they will be right.

Capsule:** Coming from the planet Kiss, a planet of flowers, Lily is a premiere entertainer. She‚Äôs capable and confident, not bogged down by conscience. Her love of money is her only major fault. So when the agents of the Empire come and enlist her help in ensnaring the ‚ÄúVIPs‚Äù, she does not need much convincing. Lily has mastered all of the flower planet‚Äôs seduction techniques, including the ability to control her potent pheromones which are capable of making most males around her act like miniature poodles. She will use all her charms to ensnare the VIPs, but as she does not know all the ins-and-outs of the Imperial Agents‚Äô operation, she will turn out to be a poor liar. In any case, the gamemaster is encouraged to portray her as a lovely and naive gamemaster character, a sort of space Marylin Monroe from the movie *Nobody Else But You*.

### Pegasus Station Communications Systems
All communication systems are closely monitored by the Empire's intelligence agents and all audio and video links are listened to and, if necessary, diverted.

### Stormtrooper Positions
The Imperial agents quickly dispatched several Stormtrooper squads to the station to monitor the security services of Pegasus XIII and to ensure that the plan was proceeding normally.

They are to appear only at the last minute, when Imperial agents have the information they want.

**Their orders:**
- Intervene as soon as the characters have betrayed themselves.
- Intervene as soon as the characters have discovered the deception
- Intervene as soon as the characters are about to leave the station.
- Intervene as soon as the characters are about to leave the station (beforehand, we will have tried to hold them back by less radical means - see the paragraph **Blocking the Characters**).

### Instructions to Dealers
The management of Pegasus XIII, under the orders of the Empire, has issued the following instruction to all its employees: the characters are VIPs, and they must be made to win and satisfy all their desires.

This instruction comes from the intelligence agents of the Empire, who think that by plunging the characters into drunkenness and the madness of a night of gambling will increase the chances that something will slip.

This tactic has advantages and disadvantages: the employees of Pegasus XIII can talk to each other, rumors can spread about the VIP status of the characters and return to the players‚Äô ears which will not fail to amaze them. Also, professional players visiting the station can take umbrage that they were not offered the same VIP status and confront the characters. Whatever occurs, the players can quickly make use of the situation and use it to benefit their characters.  They can then legitimately wonder why and act on it. 

This is precisely what **Aaron Prast** will think, an old gambling table regular who can probe the characters about the games they've played, why they are here, and otherwise size up the characters' VIP status.

Capsule:** Aaron is a gambler originally from the Inner Core. He has traveled much to earn credits from gambling tables across the galaxy. He does not have strong political views and the intrigues of the Empire are indifferent to him, although on thinking about it, well, the henchmen of Paporius VI tend to stoke his temper. Odds? He gives the Rebel Alliance 10 against 1 that they don‚Äôt finish the race. Aaron has a habit of flipping a very old piece of yellow metal[^5] between his fingers, claiming it‚Äôs gold. It‚Äôs an antique piece from a collection. Aaron is a professional gambler and player who can recognize a cheater across the room. He himself does not cheat‚Äìhe is not crazy and understands the game can always turn against him. When he approaches the characters, it is not to reproach them, but to offer a deal‚Äìif they play the same tables as him he can gain a few tidbits about who the players are, and what their goals are. He is cautious about the VIP newcomers, but hopes to profit from this gamble of which he does not completely understand neither the ins nor outs.

[^5]: Aaron Prast is supposed to have an actual coin from Old Mexico on Earth ‚Äì I left that out and just called it a piece of gold to not break the suspension of disbelief.

## Blocking the Characters
For the Empire's plan to succeed, it takes time. It's necessary that the characters do not leave Pegasus XIII, which is a kind of gilded prison for them. First, the Imperial agents will intervene against any attempted departure of the characters, gently so as not to ruin all their hopes. All pretexts will be good to prevent characters from leaving the station: the seats on this shuttle are full, the shuttles are grounded for repair, and the station is under quarantine, et cetera.

The management can even go so far as to make them win the ‚ÄúSuper Jackpot‚Äù, which consists of a week all expenses paid on the station: the important thing is that the characters stay and talk!

If the Imperial agents‚Äô plan is overturned or discovered by the characters, their orders are then to capture them alive, so that the Imperials can try to make them speak in a more traditional way. This is a tactic of the last resort for the Imperials, who believe they derive much more benefit from their current scheme. 

In fact, they are never sure of the information obtained by torture: it is always possible that the ‚Äúpatient‚Äù gives false coordinates, the verification of which will take time.

## Conclusion
After 72 hours, the information held by the player characters no longer has any value: the rebel fleet will have found another transit port and Empire cruisers could not intercept it, that's the good news. Indeed, when Alliance intelligence realizes that the players have not checked in, or that a link in the communication chain has been broken, they immediately take emergency measures and Itkal base is evacuated.

For the characters all is not so rosy. Imperial agents are also aware of the 72-hour period, and will increasingly put pressure on the characters to make sure the information is gained when it matters. 

If the 72-hour window passes, they will give the green light for the agents embarked on Pegasus XIII to purely and simply eliminate the characters. It will be interesting to see how the players find a way to leave the station as quickly and as discreetly as possible under this pressure.

## Last Chance
In the last six hours before the deadline or before the characters discover the honeypot, the agents of the Empire will attempt a last move. They will order more officers to capture the characters alive (which ay not be so easy), and start torturing them by asking them about the courier data, and the location of the Rebel base. 

After a few minutes, a known face will intervene (either Lily, or even Roba) who ‚Äúgets rid of the agents‚Äù and ‚Äúdelivers‚Äù the characters. Soon in passageways, he or she will ask the characters to pass him or her the message very quickly because it may be impossible for everyone to get off this station alive.

If the characters fall into the trap, the curtain is drawn and Stormtroopers intervene. Our heroes
may be very surprised to see the agents allegedly
eliminated by their savior among the attackers!

If the characters still refuse to give their information, the curtain is still pulled back to reveal a squad of stormtroopers, but in this case the characters can attempt to escape without betraying the fleet or their base‚Äôs location.

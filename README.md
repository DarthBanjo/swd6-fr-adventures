# Translated Star Wars D6 Roleplaying Game Adventures

Roughly translated by Darth Banjo in 2023 (and 2025 because apparently I forget to finish things) from Backstab Magazine, originally published in French. Backstab was a French roleplaying magazine published from 1996 to 2005 by FC Publications. Some Star Wars roleplaying articles and adventures were printed in the magazine.

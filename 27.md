[^2]: Gochaq has recently started working for the Empire: he has learned that his wife and son are being held by the ISB. In exchange for information, the Empire leaves his family alone. He is struggling with this situation. To avoid any indiscretion, he remains voluntarily isolated and difficult to contact.

## Setting
The planet Séléann is a desert world with few settlements, mainly employees of Incom's research center and a rough underbelly of society. Since the Empire's rise, stormtroopers and the Imperial Intelligence Bureau have taken up residence in the capital city of Kamala. The Bureau is searching for documents related to a new fighter project named T-65. Some Incom employees have hidden data in an old abandoned base, intent on delivering it to the Rebellion. The Imperial Security Bureau has arrested the players and their parents to pressure them to hand over the T-65 project. 

## Start Here, read this.
> "You and your families have been rounded up by the Imperial Security Bureau. Your parents were starship engineers for the Incom Corporation, and are being charged with treason by the Empire: for threatening to give the X-Wing Fighter to the fledgling Rebellion. You are locked in a stark, metallic interrogation room, with dim lights flickering overhead. You're waiting to be interrogated, and probably used as leverage to get your parents to cave to Imperial pressure, when blaster fire echoes through the corridors. Chaos ensues, and it dawns on you: it's your chance to escape."

Hand out the pregenerated character backgrounds. The players have 18D to spend on Attribute Dice at this point. Save the 7D skill dice for later.

## Pre-Generated Characters
Some characters are created for quickly jumping into the action, and prompting players for ideas. Remember that the player characters are supposed to be teenagers. They can be of any gender, even if the origial French text made them all boys.

| Corran  | Dantek | Lesnan |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Corran is the only child of a farming family located on Seleann. His parents own the largest hydroponic farm and employ many workers, providing work for many residents. Like a certain Luke, Corran does not see himself ending his life on this planet, or at least not on a farm. He particularly enjoys hunting Tian-Ki (small predator) with his blaster rifle. His father, a pro-Republican, was a permanent supporter of democracy on Seleann. Since the governor openly announced his support for the new Empire and the administrative council was dissolved, Corran's father has stopped financing development aid to the province.  | Dantek's father was, several years ago, a prominent senator who sat in the parliament of Seleann. His reputation as incorruptible made him a respected man among the population and feared by his enemies. He was one of the first to protest the arrival of an Imperial contingent of soldiers on the planet. Having received a good education, Dantek is undoubtedly a leader of men. His charisma and intelligence make him a future diplomat. He knows many people and even knows some little secrets about them. He dreams of traveling, meeting new races, and new women... | Born to unknown parents, Lesnan spent much of his childhood in the slums of Kamala, living off small expedients before starting to work for the Baron, an enigmatic character controlling much of the illegal business in the city. However, Lesnan has a strong penchant for independence, and lately, he has been diverting money that rightfully belongs to the Baron. He is looking for new horizons because, for him, Seleann is a constraint. A little boastful, he is faithful in friendship. |

| Hardeen  | Estan | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| Born to a couple of researchers working for Incom, Hardeen has always been a withdrawn child, not because of shyness, but because of fear. Indeed, he realized that he was capable of feats with the Force. In love with books, Hardeen met an old librarian who explained to him where his abilities came from. Unfortunately, he died before he could fully train Hardeen. He is now looking for his way, hoping to find someone capable of instructing him. | This young boy dreams of only one thing: to become like his late father, an explorer. He wants to discover other universes and uncover new civilizations. However, his mother does not see this in a good light - she counts heavily on him to assume the responsibility of his brothers and sisters. Curious and inventive, Estan eagerly awaits the moment which will let him realize his dream. |

The game starts now. They can use their wits and available resources, like dismantling a chair to use the metal legs as makeshift weapons or finding a loose panel to access the ventilation system.

Ideas of problems to overcome:
- A locked door, a loose ventilation panel.
- An Imperial ISB officer with his back turned to the players, distracted by an attacker down the hall.
- A mouse droid threatens to alert the authorities to the players' escape.
- One of their parents sacrifices themselves to hold off a squad of stormtroopers, so that their kids can make it out. 

Scene Resolution:
Eventually the players make their exit, and an injured Incom Engineer hands the players a datapad and holorecorder before succumbing to his wounds. The holorecorder reveals the Rebel spy’s final message, urging them to deliver the data to a man named Harlan, the only one they can trust. Harlan was an Incom engineer with their parents, and worked at a secret base none of them have visited. The players see the attackers withdrawing from the Imperial compound, Rebel Alliance commandos. They should have the option/invitation to flee with them. If the players choose not to go with them, they're on their own on Séléann's streets.

## Option A: A New Future!
The Rebel Alliance Commandos depart on a ground transport skiff named the Hispaniola. A smattering of commandos and rescued prisoners are aboard. If the players chose to board the skiff, they are treated kindly to rations, but learn that their parents did not survive. Meanwhile, the players can take a closer look at the objects they were given. The datapad contains visibly coded data, while the holorecorder shows the man who gave them the objects explaining that they must absolutely give them to a man named Harlan--he's the only one they can trust. The players are taken to a small staging area serving as a refuge for the Alliance. The Rebellion promises to do everything possible for the players if they complete their parents' work-- deliver the prototype T-65 Starfighter to the Rebel Alliance. 

NPCS: 
- Lieutenant Marcus is a rebel commando who watches over and interacts with the player characters. 

Problems to Overcome: 
- Imperial pursuit, maybe on speeder bikes.
- Who do we trust?

## Option B: Less than exciting prospects.
Upon fleeing the scene, the characters have to deal with nightfall on the planet, wandering the streets, and trying to get things from their former homes without the Imperials finding them out. If they make it to their homes, one of them finds a note or some sort of message saying that the Rebellion is to be trusted, and the prototype fighter should make its way to Alliance hands. The players learn that their parents did not survive.

Problems to Overcome:
- A few thugs on the streets
- A patrol of Imperial troops
- A stormtrooper searching one of their residences.
- Can we do this on our own?
- Who do we trust?

### Who are the Player Characters?
The player characters are essentially teenagers of Incom Engineers, or their friends who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. At this point you can complete character creation, assigning 7D to skills. If they went with the rebels: they have access to a few basic weapons and equipment. If they went out on their own, they will have to find equipment and weapons on the streets of the city. 

Just ordinary citizens, they possess only a few skills outside of the ordinary, stemming from their passions or their familial and social background. 

## Setting Off For Adventure
The Rebellion assigns Sergeant Atorn and two of his men to accompany the players on their hunt for this man named Harlan. The Alliance cannot decrypt the data on the datapad, so they assign the minimum number of commandos to help so as not to raise suspicions. They're dressed in casual civilian clothes, and are armed with blaster pistols (4D damage). The Alliance's only clue to find Harlan is an address in Dogyl, one of the towns near Kamala. He is a former engineer who worked for Incom. He was part of a political movement opposed to the Empire. Since the arrival of Imperial troops on Séléann, there has been no news of him or a number of other engineers. It is believed that they have gone into hiding or fled, or for some, that they have died. Harlan remains the safest source for getting hold of the T-65 for now. However, the orders are clear: if the mission were to fail, the PCs must ensure that this project does not fall into the hands of the Empire in any way.

NPCS:  
- Sergeant Atorn (All Stats 3D, Combat skills 5D, Command/Interpersonal skills 4D)
- Rebel Commando Yanis (All stats 3D, Combat skills 4D, Technical skills 3D)
- Rebel Commando Gochaq[^2] (All stats 3D, Combat skills 4D, Con, Sneak, 5D)

## On the trail of Harlan

The players are dropped off near the town of Dogyl. It has a small population of around a hundred, and its main activities are focused on hydroponic agriculture. The only lead the Players have is Harlan's last known address, which is a single-story house located on the outskirts of the village. A quick search of the house reveals that it has already been visited and there are signs of a struggle dating back several days. By going around the neighboring houses, the PCs can learn that a group of men came to take Harlan one evening more than a week ago. Just over four days ago, an Imperial detachment also came to the location and questioned the neighbors. A little boy remembers the visitors from the night: among them was a man with a tattoo covering half of his face. He had never seen anything like it before, and the tattooed man seemed to be in charge of the others. After taking Harlan (who was tied up and gagged), they headed towards Kamala.

Problems to overcome:
- Searching for clues
- Convincing the frightened neighbors to talk
- A water-peddler wants to sell them some water, and becomes beligerent if they refuse.

**In Search of the Tattooed Man**
When heading to the provincial capital, the players should notice wanted posters with their faces on them. They are at risk of being reported if people find out about them. They will also have the misfortune of learning that more Incom Engineers have been killed (Propaganda: "The Emperor has saved you from these vile traitors!"). 

The gamemaster is invited to draw inspiration from the Mos Eisley cantina to describe the different bars and clubs, as well as the local aliens and people that frequents them. The player characters, who are only young teenagers, may have problems asserting themselves in this world. They may also be laughed off by the grown-ups, or worse.[^1] 

However, their search will lead them to meet a man named Xyu who claims to know the tattooed man. He arranges to meet the player characters near an old grain silo on the outskirts of the city. It is actually an ambush. The man has recognized them and hopes to collect the bounty on the players. He has also teamed up with some ruffians (the number depends on the gamemaster). They will flee as soon as two of them are killed. However, Xyu will go directly to the Imperial authorities to inform them of the presence of the player characters in the city. From now on, patrols are ordered to be careful, and identity checks are increased. However, the deaths of the Incom Engineers are having opposite results to those expected. Part of the population is outraged by the execution of hostages. A convincing roll by the players might encourage the population to take their side and allow for a well-timed distraction. 

This city lives in terror. Stormtroopers roam it, not hesitating to unexpectedly rough up citizens. There is a latent fear among the inhabitants who no longer trust anyone. Rumors circulate about traitors who denounce anyone whose sympathies towards the Empire are doubtful. It is best to take inspiration from the atmosphere of occupied France during World War II.

They will eventually learn that the person they are looking for is named Drayleck and works freelance for anyone wealthy enough to afford his services. For several days, he has been squatting in the company of women, gambling, and drinking. If the players can get hold of him, he can tell them that he worked on commission for the Baron. He knows nothing more and has absolutely no idea where Harlan may be. He himself will soon leave - he has been hired for a new contract. He will not report his contact with the players to the Baron, as this matter no longer concerns him. 

A successful threat or persuasion roll might yield his advice: monitoring the Baron's different residences. By doing some research, the players discover that the Baron actually owns three houses in the distant outskirts of Kamala, as well as an old abandoned mine. By keeping watch outside the residences, the players will see that nothing is happening. However, the Baron sometimes uses a mine on the edge of town to interrogate people. 

NPCS:
- Xyu
- Some ruffians
- Drayleck (The Tattooed Man)

Obstacles to overcome:
- Oh great, we're wanted now.
- Where would you hide if you were the tattooed man?
- How do we get past this checkpoint?
- How do we convince Drayleck?

## Deliverance
Around the old abandoned mine are the remains of several buildings left to the winds and sands for many years. The Baron uses this place to get rid of his enemies, interrogate opponents, and as a storage location. A garrison composed of about ten men remains on the site. There is only one entrance, guarded permanently. Only the first and second levels of the mine have been fitted out. Another exit is known only to members of the Baron's network. It is used only in case of emergency evacuation. In addition, a system for destroying the site has been provided. Harlan is held in a cell located on level one. He is seriously injured but for the moment his captors give him a respite. The henchmen ensure security by rotation. They are divided into two teams, one for night and the other for day. There are always two men on guard at the entrance, relieved every four hours. However, these mobsters take their task a little lightly: they are convinced that no one would dare to attack a property of the Baron. He himself wants the T-65 prototype plans from Harlan, and will attempt to make him talk. The latter has not yet cracked, but he is in a bad state - the Baron's henchmen were not gentle with him. The engineer is the last to know where the secret base is, as his other colleagues have fallen victim to the Baron's men.

Once released, it is still necessary to convince Harlan that this is not a ruse by his torturers but indeed the Rebellion. He is near death and has been heavily tortured. Nevertheless, he is capable of revealing the coordinates of the base where the T-65 prototype is located.

NPCS:
- The Baron (All stats 3D, Knowledge skills 6D)
- The Baron's Henchmen (All Stats 2D, Combat stats 3D; Blaster Pistol 4D)
- Harlan (All stats 1D, Willpower 5D)

Obstacles to Overcome:
- How do we get in to the mine?
- How do we get past the guards?

## Betrayal!

This is the moment Gochaq (one of the commandos with the party, recently in the employ of the Imperials) chooses to take action. He radios the Imperial authorities. The Imperials have his family captive, and he must deliver this information or else. Scouts are on the way. He intends to get rid of the player characters. Once the location of the base has been revealed, he plans to blow up the mine to bury the PCs. Once informed, a squad of scouts is sent to the site to get their hands on the fighter. The PCs have no hope left but to try to find the emergency exit. Once released from the mine, they must hurry to get to the base as quickly as possible.

Obstacles to overcome
- How do we get to the base first?
- How do we get out of here?
- Does Gochaq die? Do we rescue his family after this?

## The Secret Base

The secret base is located in the middle of the desert, lost in a rocky massif. Its designers have melded it into the landscape, giving it the appearance of a hill. It includes three levels; one housing a hangar and workshops, the second serving as living quarters, and the third being a control room.  It comprises three levels; one housing a hangar and workshops, another containing all the facilities for permanent staff, and the last containing the machinery. It was originally a small military base, intended to monitor the region and abandoned long ago. Scientists opposed to the Empire transferred part of their various projects there, including the prototype of the T-65 fighter. 

Recently, a clan of Desert People has taken refuge near the base, preventing any direct intrusion into the building. There is access through an air duct located at the top of the hill. However, the PCs will have to be discreet if they want to avoid a confrontation with the desert warriors. The duct leads directly to the top floor, which is a large room containing all the machinery in the base. The PCs may notice that there is no power. The base is dark and only the security lights work. The gamemaster must decide whether the Empire's scouts have already arrived or whether the PCs are ahead of them. They must place the explosive charges to make the base disappear, knowing that the prototype of the T-65 fighter, the X-Wing, is in the hangar. It is in working condition. A player can take it and try to escape. For this final conclusion, the gamemaster can draw insipration from Aliens to create a gloomy atmosphere in the base, then press the players for time to create a final explosion where the PCs, pursued by Imperial commandos, manage to reach the ship at the rendezvous point. It is also possible to launch a few TIE fighters in pursuit of the PCs and end with a space battle. Your PCs have now joined the Rebellion.

Obstacles to Overcome:
- Imperial Scouts on speeders are on their way! (Or did they get here first?)
- The abandoned base is spooky:
    - large rats skitter around and jump out at the characters
    - there's no power
    - Desert raiders live here
- How do we get the T-65 fighter out?

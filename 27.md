# The T-65 Project
##### A scenario for a Star Wars RPG for four to five beginner players, whether or not they are familiar with the Star Wars universe. They play as teenagers who join the fledgling Rebellion.

**Original Title:** Le Projet T-65  **From:** Backstab Magazine Issue #27  
**Original Text:** Oliver Collin & Viking Fred **Illustrations:** Aleksi Briclot **Plan:** Bertrand Bes

*Translator random notes:  This is originally a Star Wars D20 adventure, and seems to be written more like a play session recap. I figured I’d translate it alongside the other Backstab Adventures for D6. There just might not be any gamemaster character stats for Star Wars D6, but a resourceful gamemaster can still use the adventure and fill in their own stats. I've used footnotes to mark things where appropriate.*

**After being evacuated from an Imperial detention center during a Rebel attack, the players find themselves in possession of a portion of the T-65 project, the X-Wing. The Empire wants the plans and threatens the players' parents. The Rebellion offers to help in exchange for the documents. When the players learn their parents have been executed, they must find an engineer who was kidnapped by a crime boss hoping to sell the T-65 project to the highest bidder. A race ensues between the players and the Empire to secure the prototype.**

## Preamble
The planet Séléann is a desert planet with few inhabitants, mainly employees of Incom's research center. Since the Empire's rise, stormtroopers and the Imperial Intelligence Bureau has taken up residence in the capital city of Kamala. The Bureau is searching for documents related to a new fighter project named T-65. Some Incom employees have hidden data in an old abandoned base to deliver it to the Rebellion. The Imperial Bureau has arrested the players and their parents to pressure opponents to hand over the project T-65. While waiting for interrogation, explosions and blaster shots are heard, and chaos ensues. An injured man gives the players a datapad and a holorecorder to keep away from the Empire. The players escape with a group of attackers toward a departing ship while under blaster fire.

## A New Future!
Quickly, the players will understand that they are on a rebel ship called the Hispaniola. About fifteen people have taken refuge on the ship, including commando members and prisoners. The gamemaster may decide that Imperial fighters are chasing the ship to add more action. Meanwhile, the players can take a closer look at the objects they were given. The datapad contains many visibly coded data, while the holorecorder shows the man who gave them the objects explaining that they must absolutely give them to a man named Harlan. It is of the utmost importance, the future of the Republic depends on it. Lieutenant Marcus reassures the former prisoners about their fate: the rebellion will release them.

During the journey, the players are warned that the authorities have issued an ultimatum: ten people will be shot if the escapees do not surrender within seventy-two hours. The names of the players' parents are on the list of hostages. Several solutions are available to the players. They can decide to surrender, condemning themselves to certain death, or take the initiative to release the hostages, which may lead to the same result. On the other hand, the Rebellion will do everything possible to free the players' parents if they hand over the documents. They will then be taken to a small moon serving as a refuge for the Alliance. Once the documents are decoded, the players will learn that they are invited by the Rebellion to find the prototype of the T-65 fighter.

### Why the Player Characters?
Since the Rebellion is practically not present on the planet, it chooses to send the player characters on site, accompanied by a few commandos, because they know their world very well. They will be able to collect information, seek help in case of danger, and locate places more easily.

## Setting Off For Adventure
The PCs will undergo intense training to acquire the basics that will serve them on their mission. The game master can thus complete the character creation. They have little time to acquire the basics that will allow them to survive. Sergeant Atorn and two of his men named Yanis and Gochaq will accompany them. Note that Gochaq has recently started working for the Empire: he has learned that his wife and son are being held by the ISB. In exchange for information, the Empire leaves his family alone. He is struggling with this situation. To avoid any indiscretion, he remains voluntarily isolated and difficult to contact.

The Alliance's only clue to find Harlan is an address in Dogyl, one of the towns near Kamala. He is a former engineer who worked for Incom. He was part of a political movement opposed to the Empire. Since the arrival of Imperial troops on Séléann, there has been no news of him or a number of other engineers. It is believed that they have gone into hiding or fled, or for some, that they have died. Harlan remains the safest source for getting hold of the T-65 for now. However, the orders are clear: if the mission were to fail, the PCs must ensure that this project does not fall into the hands of the Empire in any way.

## The Characters
At the beginning of this scenario, the characters are just ordinary citizens of a planet lost in the galaxy. They possess only a few skills outside of the ordinary, stemming from their passions or their familial and social background. The game master's role is to make the players understand that their characters have an incredible opportunity, despite the dangers, to travel or accomplish extraordinary things.

The players should have a say in their skills and stats, but they should remember to remain realistic in relation to their upbr, but they must remain realistic in relation to their classes and background.

# The T-65 Project
##### A scenario for a Star Wars RPG for four to five beginner players, whether or not they are familiar with the Star Wars universe. They play as teenagers who join the fledgling Rebellion.

**Original Title:** Le Projet T-65  **From:** Backstab Magazine Issue #27

*Translator random notes:  This is originally a Star Wars D20 adventure, and seems to be written more like a play session recap. I figured I’d translate it alongside the other Backstab Adventures for D6. There just might not be any gamemaster character stats for Star Wars D6, but a resourceful gamemaster can still use the adventure and fill in their own stats. I've used footnotes to mark things where appropriate.*

**After being evacuated from an Imperial detention center during a Rebel attack, the players find themselves in possession of a portion of the T-65 project, the X-Wing. The Empire wants the plans and threatens the players' parents. The Rebellion offers to help in exchange for the documents. When the players learn their parents have been executed, they must find an engineer who was kidnapped by a crime boss hoping to sell the T-65 project to the highest bidder. A race ensues between the players and the Empire to secure the prototype.**

## Preamble
The planet Séléann is a desert planet with few inhabitants, mainly employees of Incom's research center. Since the Empire's rise, stormtroopers and the Imperial Intelligence Bureau has taken up residence in the capital city of Kamala. The Bureau is searching for documents related to a new fighter project named T-65. Some Incom employees have hidden data in an old abandoned base to deliver it to the Rebellion. The Imperial Bureau has arrested the players and their parents to pressure opponents to hand over the project T-65. While waiting for interrogation, explosions and blaster shots are heard, and chaos ensues. An injured man gives the players a datapad and a holorecorder to keep away from the Empire. The players escape with a group of attackers toward a departing ship while under blaster fire.

## A New Future!
Quickly, the players will understand that they are on a rebel ship called the Hispaniola. About fifteen people have taken refuge on the ship, including commando members and prisoners. The gamemaster may decide that Imperial fighters are chasing the ship to add more action. Meanwhile, the players can take a closer look at the objects they were given. The datapad contains many visibly coded data, while the holorecorder shows the man who gave them the objects explaining that they must absolutely give them to a man named Harlan. It is of the utmost importance, the future of the Republic depends on it. Lieutenant Marcus reassures the former prisoners about their fate: the rebellion will release them.

During the journey, the players are warned that the authorities have issued an ultimatum: ten people will be shot if the escapees do not surrender within seventy-two hours. The names of the players' parents are on the list of hostages. Several solutions are available to the players. They can decide to surrender, condemning themselves to certain death, or take the initiative to release the hostages, which may lead to the same result. On the other hand, the Rebellion will do everything possible to free the players' parents if they hand over the documents. They will then be taken to a small moon serving as a refuge for the Alliance. Once the documents are decoded, the players will learn that they are invited by the Rebellion to find the prototype of the T-65 fighter.

### Why the Player Characters?
Since the Rebellion is practically not present on the planet, it chooses to send the player characters on site, accompanied by a few commandos, because they know their world very well. They will be able to collect information, seek help in case of danger, and locate places more easily.

## Setting Off For Adventure
The PCs will undergo intense training to acquire the basics that will serve them on their mission. The game master can thus complete the character creation. They have little time to acquire the basics that will allow them to survive. Sergeant Atorn and two of his men named Yanis and Gochaq will accompany them. Note that Gochaq has recently started working for the Empire: he has learned that his wife and son are being held by the ISB. In exchange for information, the Empire leaves his family alone. He is struggling with this situation. To avoid any indiscretion, he remains voluntarily isolated and difficult to contact.

The Alliance's only clue to find Harlan is an address in Dogyl, one of the towns near Kamala. He is a former engineer who worked for Incom. He was part of a political movement opposed to the Empire. Since the arrival of Imperial troops on Séléann, there has been no news of him or a number of other engineers. It is believed that they have gone into hiding or fled, or for some, that they have died. Harlan remains the safest source for getting hold of the T-65 for now. However, the orders are clear: if the mission were to fail, the PCs must ensure that this project does not fall into the hands of the Empire in any way.

## The Characters
At the beginning of this scenario, the characters are just ordinary citizens of a planet lost in the galaxy. They possess only a few skills outside of the ordinary, stemming from their passions or their familial and social background. The game master's role is to make the players understand that their characters have an incredible opportunity, despite the dangers, to travel or accomplish extraordinary things.

The players should have a say in their skills and stats, but they should remember to remain realistic in relation to their upbr, but they must remain realistic in relation to their classes and background.

## On the trail of Harlan

The players are dropped off near the town of Dogyl. It has a small population of around a hundred, and its main activities are focused on hydroponic agriculture. The only lead the PCs have is Harlan's last known address, which is a single-story house located on the outskirts of the village. A quick search of the house reveals that it has already been visited and there are signs of a struggle dating back several days. By going around the neighboring houses, the PCs can learn that a group of men came to take Harlan one evening more than a week ago. Just over four days ago, an Imperial detachment also came to the location and questioned the neighbors. A little boy remembers the visitors from the night: among them was a man with a tattoo covering half of his face. He had never seen anything like it before, and the tattooed man seemed to be in charge of the others. After taking Harlan (who was tied up and gagged), they headed towards Kamala.

**In Search of the Tattooed Man**

When heading to the provincial capital, players should not forget that they are wanted and risk being reported as their heads have a bounty on them. They will also have the misfortune of learning that the hostages have been killed, and that a new execution is planned in forty-eight hours. The only chance of finding the trace of the tattooed man is to tour the bars in the area.

The gamemaster is invited to draw inspiration from the Mos Eisley cantina to describe the different bars and clubs, as well as the local aliens and people that frequents them. The player characters, who are only young teenagers, may have problems asserting themselves in this world. They may also be laughed off by the grown-ups, or worse.[^1] 

However, their search will lead them to meet a man named Xyu who claims to know the tattooed man. He arranges to meet the player characters near an old grain silo on the outskirts of the city. It is actually an ambush. The man has recognized them and hopes to collect the bounty on the players. He has also teamed up with some ruffians (the number depends on the gamemaster). They will flee as soon as two of them are killed. However, Xyu will go directly to the Imperial authorities to inform them of the presence of the player characters in the city. From now on, patrols are ordered to be careful, and identity checks are increased. However, the terror policy practiced by the ISB is having opposite results to those expected. Part of the population is outraged by the execution of hostages. While the players are being checked by stormtroopers, the population takes their side and allows them to escape. 

They will eventually learn that the person they are looking for is named Drayleck and works freelance for anyone wealthy enough to afford his services. For several days, he has been squatting in the company of women, gambling, and drinking. If the players can get hold of him, he can tell them that he worked on commission for the Baron. He knows nothing more and has absolutely no idea where the engineer may be. He himself will soon leave - he has been hired for a new contract. He will not report his contact with the players to the Baron, as this matter no longer concerns him. However, he advises monitoring the Baron's different residences. With the presence of stormtroopers, it is too risky for him to keep the planet's most wanted man. Indeed, they do not hesitate to carry out unexpected searches of individuals' homes. By doing some research, the players discover that the Baron actually owns three houses in the distant outskirts of Kamala, as well as an old abandoned mine. By keeping watch outside the residences, the players will see that nothing is happening. However, the Baron sometimes goes to the mine to make Harlan talk. The latter has not yet cracked, but he is in a bad state - the Baron's henchmen were not gentle with him. The engineer is the last to know where the secret base is, as his other colleagues have fallen victim to the Baron's men.

### About Kamala
This city lives in terror. Stormtroopers roam it, not hesitating to unexpectedly rough up citizens. There is a latent fear among the inhabitants who no longer trust anyone. Rumors circulate about traitors who denounce anyone whose sympathies towards the Empire are doubtful. It is best to take inspiration from the atmosphere of occupied France during World War II.

## Deliverance
Around the old abandoned mine are the remains of several buildings left to the winds and sands for many years. The Baron uses this place to get rid of his enemies and as a storage location. A garrison composed of about ten men remains on the site. There is only one entrance, guarded permanently. Only the first and second levels of the mine have been fitted out. Another exit is known only to members of the Baron's network. It is used only in case of emergency evacuation. In addition, a system for destroying the site has been provided. Harlan is held in a cell located on level one. He is seriously injured but for the moment his captors give him a respite. The henchmen ensure security by rotation. They are divided into two teams, one for night and the other for day. There are always two men on guard at the entrance, relieved every four hours. However, these mobsters take their task a little lightly: they are convinced that no one would dare to attack a property of the Baron. Once released, it is still necessary to convince Harlan that this is not a ruse by his torturers but indeed the Rebellion. He is moribund and knows that he is condemned to a very near future. He has been heavily tortured. Nevertheless, he is capable of revealing the coordinates of the base where the T-65 prototype is located.

## Betrayal!

This is the moment Gochaq (one of the commandos with the party, recently in the employ of the Imperials) chooses to take action. He intends to get rid of the player characters. Once in possession of the data, he plans to blow up the mine to bury the PCs. He has equipped himself with explosives, which he has hidden in key locations during the exploration of the mine. Once outside, Gochaq must go to the Imperial authorities to report the location of the secret base (he prefers not to communicate via comlink for fear of being listened to, as he must maintain his cover in the Rebellion). Once informed, a squad of scouts is sent to the site to get their hands on the fighter. The PCs have no hope left but to try to find the emergency exit. Once released from the mine, they must hurry to get to the base as quickly as possible.

## The Secret Base

The secret base is located in the middle of the desert, lost in a rocky massif. Its designers have melded it into the landscape, giving it the appearance of a hill. It includes three levels; one housing a hangar and workshops, the second serving as living quarters, and the third being a control room.  It comprises three levels; one housing a hangar and workshops, another containing all the facilities for permanent staff, and the last containing the machinery. It was originally a small military base, intended to monitor the region and abandoned long ago. Scientists opposed to the Empire transferred part of their various projects there, including the prototype of the T-65 fighter. 

Recently, a clan of Desert People has taken refuge near the base, preventing any direct intrusion into the building. There is access through an air duct located at the top of the hill. However, the PCs will have to be discreet if they want to avoid a confrontation with the desert warriors. The duct leads directly to the top floor, which is a large room containing all the machinery in the base. The PCs may notice that there is no power. The base is dark and only the security lights work. The game master must decide whether the Empire's scouts have already arrived or whether the PCs are ahead of them. They must place the explosive charges to make the base disappear, knowing that the prototype of the T-65 fighter, the X-Wing, is in the hangar. It is in working condition. A player can take it and try to escape. For this final conclusion, the gamemaster can draw insipration from Aliens to create a gloomy atmosphere in the base, then press the players for time to create a final explosion where the PCs, pursued by Imperial commandos, manage to reach the ship at the rendezvous point. It is also possible to launch a few TIE fighters in pursuit of the PCs and end with a space battle. Your PCs have now joined the Rebellion.

Roughly translated by Darth Banjo in 2023 from Backstab Magazine, originally published in French.

Translator random notes: This is originally a Star Wars D20 adventure, and seems to be written more like a play session recap. I figured Iâ€™d translate it alongside the other Backstab Adventures for D6. There just might not be any gamemaster character stats, but a resourceful gamemaster can still use the adventure and fill in their own stats.

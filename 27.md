# The T-65 Project
##### A scenario for a Star Wars RPG for four to five beginner players, whether or not they are familiar with the Star Wars universe. They play as teenagers who join the fledgling Rebellion.

**Original Title:** Le Projet T-65  **From:** Backstab Magazine Issue #27  
**Original Text:** Oliver Collin & Viking Fred **Illustrations:** Aleksi Briclot **Plan:** Bertrand Bes

*Translator random notes:  I've used footnotes to mark things where appropriate. This is originally a Star Wars D20 adventure, and seems to be written more like a play session recap. I figured Iâ€™d translate it alongside the other Backstab Adventures for D6. There just might not be any gamemaster character stats for Star Wars D6, but a resourceful gamemaster can still use the adventure and fill in their own stats.*

**After being evacuated from an Imperial detention center during a Rebel attack, the players find themselves in possession of a portion of the T-65 project, the X-Wing. The Empire wants the plans and threatens the players' parents. The Rebellion offers to help in exchange for the documents. When the players learn their parents have been executed, they must find an engineer who was kidnapped by a crime boss hoping to sell the T-65 project to the highest bidder. A race ensues between the players and the Empire to secure the prototype.**
